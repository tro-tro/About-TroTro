About us
We are technologically startup focused on disrupting the public transportation sector with a focus on the trotro space. We want to become the Uber of Trotros in West Africa but better... 

The name of our mobile application is Trotro and what it does is to allow riders to select their destination points, book seats on the bus :minibus:, make digital payments via mobile money to confirm their seat, make music/documentary requests to be played whilst on the ride,  and enjoy safe, convenient and uninterrupted journeys from their pickup location to their destinations. 

Our service strictly sticks to time. If the departure time is 6:00AM, the driver moves the car at exactly 6:00AM :watch: and does not wait a second longer to ensure our riders get to their work or home destinations on time. 

Trotro is cashless and our buses only stops at the destination areas hence there are no unnecessary stops to pick up people along the way which delays people on the bus. 

We have created a solid model to guarantee that our buses are fully booked with every ride with our carefully selected pickup locations and destination points. 

We are sure our platform will bring structure and peace to the currently chaotic Trotro situation we have in the country and we would be so grateful and humble to share our journey with you.
